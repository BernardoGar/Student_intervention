    "Welcome to the second project of the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree! In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header. Carefully read each question and provide thorough answers in the following text boxes that begin with **'Answer:'**. Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

    "So far, we have converted all _categorical_ features into numeric values. For the next step, we split the data (both features and corresponding labels) into training and test sets. In the following code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Randomly shuffle and split the data (`X_all`, `y_all`) into training and testing subsets.\n",
    "  - Use 300 training points (approximately 75%) and 95 testing points (approximately 25%).\n",
    "  - Set a `random_state` for the function(s) you use, if provided.\n",
    "  - Store the results in `X_train`, `X_test`, `y_train`, and `y_test`."

    "### **Answer: **\n",
    "References at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "**K-Nearest Neighbors**\n",
    "\n",
    "I found that k-nearest neighbors was used for fault detection on the industrial practice of plasma etching at Texas instruments. The previous used method was PCA analysis. The workers would check which observations had values too far from the usual values, assuming a distribution. They could do that with one or two components. The main problem using this approach was that pca assumes a linear relation between all the variables; and thus does not work well on multimodal data. \n",
    "\n",
    "***Advantages***\n",
    "\n",
    "The researchers He & Wang proposed a K-nn approach to the problem. The reasons they mentioned are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is a simple method to apply, and whoever uses it is not blind to how each prediction is made (as one could feel when trying to understand the predictions of a complex neural network)\n",
    "- Non-linearity and multimodality do not affect the predictions. As long as enough data is provided, K-nn is immune to those cases. This contrasts to other methods like regression which is weak to multimodal data and non linear relations between the variables, and naive bayes which is weak when analysing highly correlated variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other advantages yielded by K-nn are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- New data is easily added.\n",
    "- It can be combined with regression to find relations between the variables in specific locations. For example, it may be that for students who are very bad at math; their verbal skills highly correlate with their self-esteem. But it may that that that relation is non-existant for students who are not bad at math. K-nn combined with regression could help us find those relations. \n",
    "- In makes no assumptions on the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Disadvantages***\n",
    "\n",
    "Some disadvantages K-nn has are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It may perform poorly on highly discontinious data. For example, suppose kids have numerically continiuos grades and a special prize is awarded for those kids with an average above 95 out of 100. If that prize where to deeply affect the students future; then a student with 94.9 would be very different from a student with 95. In this problem, a decision tree would be very efficient, whereas K-nn would always give bad estimations around the threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The memory requirements are very large. Whereas a prediction rule for regressions would be easy to store in just a couple of numbers; the prediction rule with K-nn is the whole dataset instead. Therefore the storage needed is obviously much more. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "***Disadvantages/Advantages***\n",
    "\n",
    "- When little data is provided, it will be hard to find the best values for categorical variables. We do not have enough information to test whether a specific value for the categorical data is more appropriate than another. For example, we may have male or female and romantic or not. If we have very little data, we may not be able to know for sure whether a romantic male is more similar to a non-romantic male or to a romantic female. Thus each categorical variable is a weakness. \n",
    "\n",
    "- On the other hand, if we have a lot of data; the flexibility when chosing the distances will become an advantage as each variable will have an optimal ponderation when measuring the distance. What I mean by this, is that may be the dummie variable for male will have a value of 3 for males and 0 for females, and the romantic variable will be 1 for romantics and 0 for not romantics. These would mean the romantic male is more similar to the not romantic male, independent of whether we are using euclidean, manhattan, or whichever other distance. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "***Why is it a good model***\n",
    "\n",
    "- Given that this data is social data, the interactions between the variables can be as crazy as the people themselves! Therefore I have no reason to think we won't face multimodality, non-linearity, and high correlations between the variables. Thus, it will be better to choose a model robust to those exact things. \n",
    "\n",
    "- If we are to implement the intervention system, we will have to convince the authorities of using it at some point. And when that point comes K-nn is an easy model to understand and believe, therefore the authorities may not be too reluctant to use it. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Suppor vector machines**\n",
    "\n",
    "I found several uses for suppor vector machines, it seemed very popular. An interesting one I found on a paper was predicting a person's height based on bone measures. This technique is important in sciences related to the study of past happenings, such as archeology. \n",
    "\n",
    "***Advantages***\n",
    "\n",
    "The researcher (Ionescu) gives the following advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It usually ameliorates results yielded by regressions (When using SVR) in terms of predcition.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It has several varieties of Kernels which can improve their power even more.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other advantages of using SVM:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can chose to use SVM or SVR, which gives a point instead of a classification. \n",
    "\n",
    "- After running it, it is very clear seeing which examples are important and which are not. This can give the researcher insights on the data base. For example, if we were to separate students in needs intervention and does not need intervention we would have important examples and not important examples. From the important examples we can obtain \"thresholds\" in the plane from which a student can need or not need intervention. One could call the space inbetween the turning point. This could tell us where we could set a policy threshold, trying to keep the students below those points. On the other hand the unimportant examples are in super need of intervention; or in super not need of intervention. All this information can help us design policies and develop qualitative theories on why the intervention depends on such variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If we are using SVR, we can get clear insights on how each variable affects the final outcome; which is very useful if we are trying to understand why students behave the way they do. \n",
    "\n",
    "- As SVM makes a hyperplane dividing data points, it can work well around discontinious effects of the variables and dummies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is a light algorithm to store\n",
    "\n",
    "***Disadvantages***\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, using SVM's can have its disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is harder to make predictions on multimodal labels. Suppose the people who are very bad at math and the people who are very good at math put a lot of attention in class. The first group because they really need to and the second group because they like studying. The only group that does not put attention is the people in the middle. SVM would have a hard time understanding the relation if we do not include non linear forms of the data, and even then it'd be hard to guess. This problem would be more easily tackled by trees or K-nn.\n",
    "\n",
    "- On the same line, it may be hard for it to identify non-linear relations on the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is computationally more expensive to make than a tree or K-nn.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It assumes the data works in the inputted function and kernel. It forcibly has to assume a shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Why is it a good model***\n",
    "\n",
    "- It would be a good first approach to see which variables are the most important when deciding to intervene.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We could identify discontiniuties in the variables. This may be the case for example on the age variable. For example perhaps the students over 18, which are allowed to leave schools in some places due to their age, behave much differently than students below 18. \n",
    "\n",
    "- From what I saw in my research, it is usually a good choice and benchmark model. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Ensemble methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "Online I found some researchers used ensemble methods to predict ecological outcomes. Specifically, they compared Bagging Trees & Random Forests .As ensemble methods, I do not think MARS counts as ensemble because the samples it takes into account are not random and the method does not take into account an average of the models, but a different model depending on the independent variables values; neither doe\n",
    "\n",
    "***Advantages***\n",
    "\n",
    "The researchers mention different specific advantages for the different ensambling methods. But I will list the general ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The methods autmatically control the variance or generalization error and it is unlikely to overfit even while making the models more complex. This allows us to test many different variations. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Due to its flexibility and capability of being very complex without overfitting it is resistant to multimodal labels, non-linearity, and categorical variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "***Disadvantages***\n",
    "\n",
    "The researchers mention the following disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ensemble methods in general are blinder to the user. In some cases all the weak learners are similar and it can be fairly clear to the user how does each variable influence the outcome. However it might be the case that each weak learner is different and it becomes very complicated to make an interpretation. The authors to mention other methods to interpret the output, but they are much more complicated than the simple interpretations one could make out of a tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is computationally very expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The ensemble methods have a very big number of hyperparameters to choose from. The problem is even larger because we could chose different combinations of weak learners and the topology of the ensamblage. It is important to note that this can be an advantage as we can change the composition to ameliorate the performance. However, given that we have infinite posibilities of combinations and hyperparameters, it will be impossible to figure the best combination. \n",
    "\n",
    "- It is sensible to pink noise. \n",
    "\n",
    "***Why is it good for the data we have***\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ensemble methods are good models as benchmark because they ahve proved to be very good in many applications.\n",

    "- Given that we have many categorical variables, hability to be complex can be very useful.\n",

    "As for the sample size, from the table we can see that 100 observations was enough. It could seem that 300 was significantly better than 200, but from further testing, it seems that even 20 observations were enough. We can see this from the fact that the F1 score remains relatively unchanged when the sample has any number between 20 and 300 observations. Even if there is a jump at the end, the lack of a clear trend indicates that the sample is enough. If there were a clear increasing trend, we could probably use more information. Therefore we do not need more data for any of the algorithms.\n",

(0.0095*3,000'000=28.5k seconds) The other two would take even less. Therefore, time costs are of no importance in this subject. The training time could change, but as we saw 300 observations was big enough, so there is no reason to change the training sample."

    "**Answer: ** SVM tries to find a threshold from which a student might need intervention. If a student is on one side then she/he does not need intervention. Otherwise, she/he does. \n",
    "\n",
    "The threshold is also not on a single variable, but rather on a combination. This means we can assign values to each of the student's variables. So suppose being a romantic means 3 points, having the mother work means 6 points and having the father work means 3 points. Now let's set the threshold at 5. This would mean that being a romantic and having a working father or mother means the student needs intervention. But if the student is not romantic, he can have his father work without the need of an intervention. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, even though there may be many thresholds, the computer finds the one which a) has the most free space from the \"first\" student who need intervention and the threshold, and b) has the most free space from the \"last\" student who does not need intervetion and the threshold. I'll explain with an example. Suppose we have four students A, B, C, and D, and the first two need interventions. Then the algorithm will try to set the values of A and B as far away as possible from C and D, so when it sets a threshold it was a lot of space between both classes. Thus, the algorithm would prefer if the values were the following: (A, B, C, D respectively) 55, 50, 145, 150 than 20, 95, 105, 180. This is because if we set the threshold right in the middle (100 in both cases) we get more space between the intervention needers and non intervention needers (45 v. 5). \n",
    "\n",
    "Having a lot of space allows us to think that in the future it will be very clear if a student needs intervention; it is of course clearer when the student is farther from the threshold. For example, it would be clearer that a student with 25 needs intervention than a student with 99. \n",
    "\n",
    "The latter specifications yield an algorithm which will make the best separation possible between both classes. It is important to note that not always is this perfect threshold possible to make. In such cases, we just try to have as less errors as possible when an example is missclassified. "
